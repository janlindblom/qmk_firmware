# Namnlos keymap stuff

Stuff and customisations used in my (namnlos) keymaps. Yeah, I know that's not my Github handle.

It's a bit of a mix of things I've mixed together and done myself, a lot of the OLED stuff comes from @drashna to name one and the SH1107 OLED driver is from @XScorpion2.

## Huffman

The Huffman stuff is from the public domain Huffman encoder/decoder by [@drichardson](github.com/drichardson): [github.com/drichardson/huffman](https://github.com/drichardson/huffman). I'm playing with the idea of storing icons/images huffman compressed/encoded in the keymap and decode them on keyboard startup. Or something like that.
